          <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
          <p>Successful sustainable e-commerce sites share common design elements: clean layouts with generous white space, nature-inspired color palettes (greens, browns, earth tones), high-quality product photography, and clear visual hierarchies that prioritize education alongside sales.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-card">
          <div class="insight-icon">🔍</div>
          <h3>Transparency Matters</h3>
          <p>All researched sites emphasize transparency through various methods: detailed product sourcing information, sustainability certifications, brand story features, and clear communication of environmental impact. Users want to know the story behind products.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-card">
          <div class="insight-icon">📚</div>
          <h3>Education as Marketing</h3>
          <p>Educational content serves dual purposes: building trust and driving conversions. Sites that integrate sustainability tips, how-to guides, and environmental news see higher engagement and customer loyalty. Education positions the brand as an authority.</p>
        </div>

      <h2 class="section-title">ECO's Unique Market Position</h2>
      
      <div class="position-content">
        <p>Through competitive analysis, we've identified ECO's distinctive positioning in the sustainable e-commerce landscape:</p>
        
        <div class="position-grid">
          <div class="position-item">
            <h3>🇳🇵 Local Focus with Global Vision</h3>
            <p>While most sustainable e-commerce sites serve Western markets, ECO champions South Asian artisans and addresses local environmental challenges. We make sustainability relevant to our community while learning from global best practices.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="position-item">
            <h3>🤝 Artisan-First Marketplace</h3>
            <p>Unlike vertically-integrated brands, we're a true marketplace connecting consumers directly with independent producers. This model ensures fair compensation, preserves traditional crafts, and offers unique product diversity.</p>

    <!-- Design Decisions -->
    <section class="decisions-section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Design Decisions</h2>
      
      <div class="decision-item">
        <h3>Visual Identity</h3>
        <p>We chose a natural, organic aesthetic using earthy greens and neutral tones. Unlike the bright, playful approach of sites like The Good Fill or the premium minimalism of Package Free, our design feels grounded and approachable—reflecting the natural materials we promote.</p>
        <div class="decision-rationale">
          <strong>Rationale:</strong> Our target audience values authenticity over polish. A natural aesthetic signals genuine commitment to environment rather than greenwashing.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="decision-item">
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>We paired the serif font Lora for headings with the clean sans-serif Work Sans for body text. This combination provides warmth and readability while avoiding the generic feel of system fonts used by many competitors.</p>
        <div class="decision-rationale">
          <strong>Rationale:</strong> Serif headings add timeless elegance suggesting quality and craftsmanship, while sans-serif body maintains modern web usability.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="research-conclusion">
      <h2>Research Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Competitive analysis reveals that sustainable e-commerce success requires balancing multiple factors: beautiful design that reflects environmental values, transparent communication about sourcing and impact, educational content that builds trust, and practical features that make sustainable choices convenient.</p>
      
      <p>ECO differentiates through local focus, artisan partnerships, affordability mission, and radical transparency. While we learn from global leaders like Patagonia, Package Free, and EarthHero, our South Asian context demands unique solutions. We're not simply replicating Western sustainable e-commerce—we're pioneering an approach that honors local traditions, supports regional artisans, and makes sustainability accessible to our community.</p>
      
      <p>This research page will evolve as we continue learning, testing, and improving. We invite feedback, questions, and suggestions from our community as we build ECO together.</p>
